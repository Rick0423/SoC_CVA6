This repository contains an implementation of a SoC (System on Chip) design using the RISC-V architecture. The design is based on the [RISC-V CVA6 CPU](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) and includes various other components such as [AXI bus](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi), [UART](https://github.com/pulp-platform/apb_uart) and [Hyperbus Interface](https://github.com/pulp-platform/hyperbus).
